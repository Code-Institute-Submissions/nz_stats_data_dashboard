# NZ Stats Data Dashboard | Javascript Data Visualisation Project

This is a single page application which uses open source javascript data visualisation libraries to explore statistical data from New Zealand's government stats website (stats.gov.nz). It is a front-end only website that provides visitors with data visualisations of data from four distinct areas:
1.	Internation Travel and Migration
2.	Food Price Index
3.	Serious Injuries
4.	Income and Work


## Demo

A demo of this site is available [here](https://jordandaly.github.io/nz_stats_data_dashboard/index.html).

This website is hosted by Github Pages, a static site hosting service which supports client-side code. It does not support server-side functionality.


## Getting started / Deployment

* If you wish to run this site locally, please clone or download this repo. You can then run index.html or open index.html in your browser.
* If you wish to deploy a live version of this site, then you will need to create your own Github repo. Navigate to settings and enable Github Pages by setting the Source to master branch. 
 

## Built With

**HTML, CSS and JavaScript (third party libraries and tools: Bootstrap, jQuery, D3.js, DC.js, Queue.js, Crossfilter.js, Intro.js, Keen.js :** Front end languages that give the application structure, style and interactivity

## UX Design

Details of the UX design and research process undertaken as part of this project is available in the 
'IFD project wireframes' folder. This document outlines how I approached the design of this site.

## Testing

Manual testing was undertaken for this application and satisfactorily passed. A sample of the tests conducted are as follows:
1.	Testing navigation buttons and hyperlinks throughout the page
2.	Testing the select filters and the individial charts making up dashboards for crossfiltering functionality
3.	Testing the responsiveness of the application on different browsers and then using different devices (please note that only the chart containers are expected to be responsive because D3.js charts are not responsive by design)
